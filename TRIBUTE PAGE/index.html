            <h2>Former Prime Minister Of India</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><p><b>Atal Bihari Vajpayee</b> ( 25 December 1924 – 16 August 2018) was an Indian politician and poet who served three terms as the 10th Prime Minister of India, first for a term of 13 days in 1996, then for a period of 13 months from 1998 to 1999, followed by a full term from 1999 to 2004. He was the first non-Indian National Congress prime minister to serve a full term in the office. Vajpayee was one of the co-founders and a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party. He was a member of the RSS, a Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation. He was also a Hindi poet and a writer.</p></li>
            <li> <p> A man of the masses, firm in his political convictions. On October 13, 1999, he took charge as <b>Prime Minister of India</b> for the second consecutive term at the head of a new coalition government, the National Democratic Alliance. He was Prime Minister for a short period in 1996. He is the first Prime Minister since Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to have become Prime Minister of India with two successive mandates</p></li>
            <li><p>A veteran Parliamentarian whose career stretches over four decades, <b>Shri Vajpayee</b> has been elected to the Lok Sabha (House of the People) nine times and to the Rajya Sabha (House of the States) twice, a record by itself.</p></li>
            <li><p>As India’s Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairperson of various important Standing Committees of<b> Parliament and Leader of the Opposition,</b> he has been an active participant in shaping India’s post-Independence domestic and foreign policy.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Shri Vajpayee’s</b> first brush with nationalist politics was in his student days, when he joined the Quit India Movement of 1942 which hastened the end of British colonial rule. A student of political science and law, it was in college that he developed a keen interest in foreign affairs – an interest he has nourished over the years and put to skilful use while representing India at various multilateral and bilateral fora.</p></li>
            <li><p>Shri Vajpayee had embarked upon a journalist’s career, which was cut short in 1951 when he joined the <b>Bharatiya Jana Sangh,</b> the fore-runner of today’s Bharatiya Janata Party, the leading component of the National Democratic Alliance. A critically acclaimed poet, he still takes time off from affairs of state of indulge in music and in a bit of gourmet cooking.</p></li>
            <li><p>Born in the family of a humble school teacher on December 25 1924, in the erstwhile <b>princely state of Gwalior </b>(now a part of the Indian State of Madhya Pradesh), Shri Vajpayee’s rise in public life is a tribute to both his political acumen and Indian democracy. Over the decades, he has emerged as a leader who commands respect for his liberal worldview and commitment to democratic ideals</p></li>
            <li><p>An ardent champion of <b>women’s empowerment and social equality,</b> Shri Vajpayee believes in a forward-looking, forward moving India, a strong and prosperous nation confident of its rightful place in the comity of nations. He stands for an India anchored in 5000 years of civilisational history, ever modernising, ever renewing, ever re-energising itself to meet the challenges of the next 1000 years.</p></li>
